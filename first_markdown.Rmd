## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packageload, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```


```{Load data, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
loc <- here("frames_ex2.csv")
frames <- read_csv(file = loc)
```
```{r skim}
skim(frames)
```
